# TimeSeriesElectricityUsagePredictions
Time Series Prediction for Forecasting Electricity Usage with AI Machine Learning Algorithms:

  According to a Time article written by Lynn Doan, the Texas power outages in February have affected
at least two million households and businesses. Without electricity or any means of attaining warmth
in these homes, when a storm hit Texas, nearly 80 people died. Electricity plays a major role in the
lives of people, and without it, it would be nearly impossible for them to accomplish their daily tasks.
As a result, the idea of electricity conservation must be handled with the same care and gravity.
Overconsumption of electricity has not only environmental consequences, but also financial ones. If the
financial costs of electricity increase because of overuse, households will no longer be able to afford,
and families must begin to lead a life without this helpful resource. The objective of this engineering
project is to create a prediction algorithm which forecasts future electricity usage based on passed
usage by implementing AI machine learning algorithms. The program utilizes the commonly used time-series
model, ARIMA or auto regressive integrated moving average model, applied on a training set in order to
identify correlations within the data and create predictions. Predictions are evaluated by comparing them
to the actual values in the test set and through calculating the overall RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
After weeks worth of working, the project yielded an RMSE of 2.132 while predicting electricity usage data
for the months of November and December.
